# IMAGE-PROCESSING-SYSTEM-NUMPY-

Since images can also be considered as made up of arrays,
we can use NumPy for performing different image processing tasks as well from scratch.
In this project, we will use the image processing tasks that can be performed only using NumPy.
The major operations to be performed using NumPy are listed below,
1: Loading image
2: Image rotation
3: Colours separation 
4: Transformation  
5: Grayscale conversion 
6: Image segmentation
